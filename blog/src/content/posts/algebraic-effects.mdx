# Algebraic Effects

[KryhtaJS](https://github.com/ihorandrianov/kryhtajs) is a tiny JavaScript engine with algebraic effects, written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. It extends JavaScript with:

- **`perform Effect!(args)`** triggers an effect and captures the continuation
- **`handle { } with { }`** catches effects and decides how to resume
- **`resume(value)`** is a one-shot continuation that resumes execution
- **First-class handlers** can be stored and reused

## Try It

<KryhtaPlayground client:only="react" />

## Generator Pattern

Effects can implement generators without special syntax. `Yield!` is just another effect:

<KryhtaPlayground client:only="react" example="generator" />

## Mutable State

State can be implemented as a pattern. The handler threads state through continuations:

<KryhtaPlayground client:only="react" example="state" />

## Early Exit

If you don't call `resume`, the computation stops:

<KryhtaPlayground client:only="react" example="exit" />

## First-Class Handlers

Handlers are values. You can store them in variables and reuse them:

<KryhtaPlayground client:only="react" example="handler" />
